Project = Pro Project
	-Working Folder (outputs)
	-Resource Foldinger (read, not edited)
		can add multiple folders
Composer>Stretch
-Stretch Current View: zoomed in area + enhance small differences in pixel value
-Stretch Symmetrical: good for both negative & positive values that need to be balanced
-Instant Stretch: good all purpose
*Layer Properties>Save, to save the stretch

Composer>Add Layer or Remove Layer
Composer>Blend Icon to mesh 2+ layers (so cool!)
Composer>Transparency Icon (all pixels w/ value of 0)
Composer>"Save Composition to Map File"

Identify Tool -> Pop-up(s) 

Raster Group File
->Easy to import multiple at once
1.In Explorer > Select all files > Click Create>Raster Group > Rename the Group

Group Link
*All files need to be opened from same group (and have same .fileName)
When all rasters are opened > Click Group Link (Linked Brushing)

Zoom Full = "Full Extent Normal"

Optimizng Rasters: TerrSet stores rasters as pyramids, which stores values of an image at several resolutions
To Create:
	1. In TerrSet Explorer > Right-click file name > Create Pyramid
		*Can be done for Raster Group
	2. File Symbol changes to triangle (from square)

Measure Length (Ruler)

Measure Zone: measures radius of circle & area w/i circle

File-> Import/Export data files
	Needs to be in Idrisi format!!
Can also "Search" for import modules
*GenericRaster
*GDAL Conversion (for nearly any raster)
	-Images importing using GDAL will not display automatically


Importing Tips & Tricks
1. In Metadata pane, can edit file metadata
2. Display Parameters
3. Post-Import Processing (reference system, extent, & resolution) should be same for rasters
	Project Module (Raster & Vector) change coordinate systems
	Window Module (Clip)
	Resample (+Geometric Correction)
	Mosaic Module - image mosaicking
	Reclass Module - reclass pixels
		Ex: Continuous Data -> Discrete-ish Categorical Data
	Raster>Vector Module: converts rasters into vectors; requires blank vector file to be created & loaded
		Vector>Raster too
