How LCM converts independent variables into a transition potential map?
How LCM uses soft prediction map to extrapolate change as a hard prediction?

LCM - 3 Runs
Earlier: 1971Built1
Later: 1985Built1

Simulate single transition from Non-Built>Built
->Map:Distance from 1971BuiltPixels
	IndVar = Distance from 1971Built
	IndVar = Elevation01
Prediction date 2085
	Markov Matrix
		1985-40%NB --> 2085Built
		1985Built100%-->2085Built
Recalculation stages: 2

Do not create video

CROSSTAB
1985Built1 + hard prediction stage1 + hard prediction @ 2085 + Mask01 => Pattern of hard prediction across two stages: 1985-2035 & 2035-2085



Run A: Logistic Regression w/o sampling & w/o zoning
Run B: Weighted Normalized Likelihood (WNL) w/o zoning
Run C: WNL w/ zoning (prevents simulated change in the protected areas as entered in the Planning tab)

-----------------
Slide1 - Title
Slide2 - 5 input maps (earlier image, later image, independent variable of distance, independent variable of elevation, Boolean protection map)
Slide3 - Analyze RunA
Slide4 - Analyzes RunB
Slide5 - Analyze RunC
^All show:
	Soft output map
	CROSSTAB of hard prediction of gain of Built through two stages
	REGRESS scatter plot
		IV: Distance from 1971 Built
		DV: Soft prediction map
		Mask: only NB @ 1985
	Explain: # pixels of gain during each stage & why;
		How LCM uses transition potential map
		Average transition potential for each soft prediction map
		Does a large avg. transition potential = >risk of larger quantity of post-1985 gain of built


RunA CROSSTAB Table
1|1|1 Persistence of NB
1|1|2 Gain of B stage 2
1|2|2 Gain of B stage 1
2|2|2 Persistence of B

TP: distance to 1971built; elevation (non-linear affects)
TP guides spatial allocation to dictate gain of built; LCM determines quantity of pixels from the Markov Matrix
