Run Geomod 2x
	Anderson02 @ 1985
	Beginning LandUse - 1985
	Ending LandUse - 1999
	14 time step
	Do not do environmental impact analysis

Run 1
Parameters: run1
	Mask
	Neighborhood search mode constrained by width 3x3
	1 simulation
	1 Driver w/ equal weights
	Driver map elevation02
	Extrapolation of gross built gain b/w 1971-1985 to determine simulated quantity 1999
	Do not output interim time images
	Use run1 as prefix

Run2
Parameters: run2
	Town maps as strata
	Neighborhood search mode unconstrained
	1 simulation
	4 drivers w/ equal weights
		elevation02
		geology
		1971 landuse 21 categories
		protection
	Use Anderson02 @ 1999 as ending time LandUse validation to determine quantity by town
	Do not output interim time images
	Use run2 as a prefix

For each run:
	CROSSTAB to show simulated changes from 1985
	Submit one PPTX file that has (for each run)
		Driver Map(s)
		Geomod Suitabilitly Map
		CROSSTAB Output of simulated changes
		+Paragraphs that describe:
			how Geomod computed suitability values
			Explain where the largest suitability values are for each run
			Behavior of Geomod simulation & assessment of validation
